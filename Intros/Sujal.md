#### Why You?
- I having a particular interest in open source motivates me to work for the project
- I have been also working on another Python Library (SymPy) so I have a basic idea about git and version control.
- I use python left and right, even using it for CP (yeah ik I have been told to do on CPP), so I am good to go with python.
- I was part of the GSoC mentee group last year, was trying to get into SymPy (yeah I failed with 0 PRs).

#### What inspires you to be a PM on the MPL Open Source Project in The Programming Club? What are your various commitments for the upcoming year? How do you plan to manage your time between them?
- This project was the only one that excited me a lot during my first research conclave in 2024.
- Given it is open source project, I want to participate in it and try to finally do something good for the community that would highly leave me satisfied.
